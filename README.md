**Automation Framework**

This is one unified automation framework that I have crafted to execute all the different types of tests.

**Prerequisites:**
1. To ensure Java and Maven are installed and configured in IDE.

2. Create a New Project by Get from VCS

4. Build Project

**Steps to execute Automation**
1. Open Runner File from TestRunner within Framework and configure the tag under tags.
   
       @UI is used to run all the UI test cases
   
       @API tag is used to run all the API test cases.
