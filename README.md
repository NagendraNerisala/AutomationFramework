**Automation Framework**

This is one unified automation framework that I have crafted to execute all the different types of tests ( ex : UI , API Automationâ€¦)

**Prerequisites:**
1. To ensure Java and Maven are installed and configured in IDE.

2. Create a New Project by Get from VCS
https://github.com/NagendraNerisala/AutomationFramework

4. Build Project

**Steps to execute Automation**
1. Open Runner File within Framework and configure the tag under tags.
       @API tag is used to run all the API test cases.  
       @UI is used to run all the UI test cases   
       @Regression is used to run all both UI and API test cases.
