**Steps to execute Automation**
1. Open Runner File from TestRunner within Framework and configure the tag under tags.
   
       @UI is used to run all the UI test cases
   
       @API tag is used to run all the API test cases.

       @Sanity tag is used to run both UI and API test cases at once.
